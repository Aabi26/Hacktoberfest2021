Article Title: World Change with the time
Author Name: Amit Shukla
Date: 4/11/21





That’s why we’ve created the “Change the World, One Article at a Time” initiative. We’ve asked the Editors-in-Chief of 
Springer Nature journals across disciplines to select the scientific 
findings published in 2016 that they believe could have the
greatest impact on society’s most pressing problems.
Spread the word about this campaign and share articles with 
your peers and colleagues, so we can all do our bit to raise awareness,
further discussions and drive forward developments to address the challenges of our time:
help to change the world!
=======================================================


he inspiration for the Change the World initiative
In the interview with Ulrike Graiff, Marketing Director Springer Nature,
hear why we launched this initiative and are proudly presenting 180 must-read articles across all disciplines that could help change the world! 

With this initiative, we not only want to support authors who are tackling today’s global challenges to facilitate real change,
we also hope to promote a sense of community among our publishing partners and customers, and show that we can make a difference – one article at a time.


THANK YOU
