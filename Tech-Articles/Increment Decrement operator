Increment Decrement operator
Explanation
Pre-increment and pre-decrement operatorsâ€™ increments or decrements the value
of the object and returns a reference to the result.
Post-increment and post-decrement creates a copy of the object, increments or
decrements the value of the object and returns the copy from before the
increment or decrement.
Post-increment(a++):
This increases value by 1, but uses old value of a in any statement.
Pre-increment(++a):
This increases value by 1, and uses increased value of a in any statement.
Post-decrement(a--):
This decreases value by 1, but uses old value of a in any statement.
Pre-decrement(++a):
This decreases value by 1, and uses decreased value of a in any statement
