**Virtual Reality**
Virtual reality means experiencing a simulated world powered by technology rather than the real world. VR is a terminology used when computers generate a 3D environment that allows the users to enter a false reality.
VR uses something called stereoscopic imagery, meaning it has two separate images for each eye of the same objects that when seen together give the illusion of it being in three dimensions. I’m sure you have seen a movie in 3D before with 3D glasses and it's very similar in concept. 
Now the magical part of VR is that because the headset blocks out your surroundings you become immersed in this virtual world that is being displayed ahead of you. Your brain sees this place and perceives them as being real. This is what makes VR so appealing to people.
Some people even go as far as to say that VR is life-changing. Your perception of the world can be warped as you realize that your body responds to what it perceives as real not necessarily what is.

**What is VR used for?**
Well, all sorts of stuff, not just games. It can be used as training for those who are entering dangerous career fields. It can be used as educational 360 videos or virtual field trips. It can even be used to create 3D art or just watching movies in a theatre all to yourself. 
Almost anything you can imagine in real life, VR can do plus more and the technology is only getting better. Most average households are using VR for video games.

**The potential for VR**
Our experience with technology for the last several decades has been largely 2 dimensional. We’ve gone from pixelated displays to displays where you can’t even see the pixels anymore. All that means that 2D tech is reaching a cusp of potential… so why not move onto 3D innovation?
Early mass adoption is going to be key to realize the potential that VR has. With modern tech, they give us a portal into another world defined by their size. Smartphones give us a tiny portal into the digital world, for example, but we still exist in the real world. 
VR, on the other hand, takes you fully out of the real world and into a digital one.
If consumers adopt VR, then developers will follow. In 2020, VR & AR revenue is set to surpass $120 billion.

**Advantages of VR technology**
1. Virtual reality created a realistic world that enables users to explore spaces and test situations without real-world consequences.
2. It is used for advancements in various fields. 
3. Provides users with detailed, lifelike experiences that they may not otherwise be able to experience.
4. Allows you to interact and converse with others.

**Disadvantages of VR technology**
1. The equipment can be very expensive to obtain.
2. Complex technology not easily replicated.
3. Unlike real-world systems, virtual reality doesn’t offer flexibility in making changes to the pre-set program sequence.
4. Potential for addiction and escapism (become over-reliant on artificial experiences).
5. Many would claim that the inauthentic experiences of VR are still not as good as the real thing.
6. Visual fatigue from excessive use.

“VR is a way to escape the real world into something more fantastic. It has the potential to be the most social technology of all time.”
~Palmer Luckey, Founder of Oculus Rift
