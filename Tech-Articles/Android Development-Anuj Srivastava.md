What to Learn to get started with Android App Development?

Yes!ðŸ¤” This question might confuse every beginner whenever they are thinking of to starting a new journey here.
So, if youâ€™re one of those enthusiasts here's my article to help you getting started with android app development.
# Choose a Platform
__Mobile development__ is a broad field and therefore this means there are multiple ways to develop an application i.e this question has more than one answers. Basically the whole mobile development community works on two fronts, one is Native development and Cross-Platform development

 - Android development -> using Kotlin and Java
 - IOS development -> using Objective C and Swift
 - Cross-Platform -> using Flutter,Ionic,Xamarin,React-Native,etc.

First two points is an example for Native and the Third one for Hybrid
By Native Development it means that is built for one specific platform. Hence written in languages compatible with the platform For instance, native Android app run on Android OS only Whereas native iOS apps run on iOS only.
With Cross-platform Development one's can write code once and run on different platforms. Hence specialized tools are taken into service, can run on both iOS and Android platforms.
For someone new to mobile development, its better to learn native first then move to cross-platform technologies( if you want to ),
As of now better hybrid technologies are React-Native and Flutter and to my understanding that to be good in these we need a pretty strong understanding on native mobile development.
So, keep this Native vs Cross-Platform for some others day topic
However this blog is focused in Native way of Android development

# Learn a LANGUAGE
For the languages, you can develop android apps either by using Kotlin or Java, Hence another confusing part for beginners.
You need to learn basic of any programming language before getting started with android such as OOPS and other such underlying concepts

1. JAVA
 - Java was the first official programming language that is used to develop android apps.
 - The support community and user base is more in Java its older than Kotlin.
 - Android is the framework written in Java, so to code android android application you need to learn java and make yourself familiar with the syntax
2. KOTLIN
 - Launched by JetBrains, who created IntelliJ IDE and it too runs on JVM
 - Google in May 2017 announced Kotlin as the official language of Android App Development
 - Kotlin made android app development much easy as the length of the code had decreased than Java , and other such features
 - For a android developer Kotlin should be the language of choice nowadays
As time is changing the companies are shifting to Kotlin. Hence its most preferred since it offers a lot as compared to Java. Google also offers a lot of support to Kotlin, like many new Jetpack APIs and features will be offered first in Kotlin.
BUT for beginners in android with no experience with any line of codes or any other programming language first learn Android development inJava, then switch to Kotlin.
3. XML(Extensible Markup Language)
 - XML is important used to design UI/UX of an app its, presentation, layouts,etc
 - Since its markup language its work is to describes data and introducing elements like sets the layout of things like buttons and images, and defines the font, color, and any text.
To recap, XML describes the views in layout, and Java/Kotlin tells them how to behave.
Its not needed to learn in depth beforehand you can learn along the way.
# ANDROID SDK
 - Android SDK stands for Android Software Development Kit which is developed by Google for Android Platform.
 - Android SDK is a collection of libraries and Software Development tools helps to create android Apps easily.
 - Its includes necessary utilities to help Android developers calling different APIs developed by Google both for controlling the device's functions and for integrating services.
 - Component of the Android SDK such as Gradle,emulator,build tool,platform tool ,etc.
 - Using an IDE Android Studio: There are many IDE available for development,but
Itâ€™s unquestionably the best IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Android
Android Studio is a must have for both the beginner and experienced Android developer.

 - Built on top of IntelliJ IDE,developed by Google for android application development.
 - Google on 16th May 2013 announced as a official IDE for Android app development.
 - Its comes with great out-of-the-box support for many of the most common Android SDKs.
 - It has advanced tools like memory monitors,CPU monitors,Code debuggers,Code completion,etc helping developers make sure their code will maintain high performance on a mobile device.
Start with android
After just understanding the basics of the above listed ,it is now time to get your hand dirty. Hence just install Android Studio and start developing an app, As Practice together along with theory is one of the best ways of learning.

One of the important skill as an android developer is of reading and searching for answer ,For development Android provides the most important and incredible documentation:-
__Android Documentation__
You wonâ€™t understand and remember everything for the first time, ones has to browse this site millions time and each time you will become one step better version from your previous.
# Happy Learning :-) #
