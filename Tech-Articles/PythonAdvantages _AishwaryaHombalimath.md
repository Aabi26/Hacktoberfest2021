Advantages of Python in AI
1.Open Source
Python is a general-purpose open-source programming language. 
This means anyone is free to use it. Not just Python the language.
There are many libraries that are available in Python for various purposes.
As you are reading this material, there is a developer in some corners of the world adding to the plethora of libraries available. 
The users of these libraries can use them as is or can inspect modify and enhance the libraries to suit their purpose. 
The contributors for Python, called the Python community, are growing bigger and bigger making new contributions.

2.Easy to Understand
Unlike many other complex programming languages like C++ and Java, Python is very easy to learn and hence you will be on your way to writing your first line of code. 
The syntax is very simple.

3.OOP and Functional Programming
Python allows users to do both Object-oriented programming, like C++ and Java, or functional programming.

4.Full-Stack
Python also allows you to seamlessly use it for server-side development which means you can provide AI as a web service (REST).

5.Flexibility 
Python works with all traditional and cloud-based databases and data collections. 
The source of data can be a simple excel file or a complex Oracle Database sitting on a server or cloud, or even a DBaS (Database as a service).

6.)Pre-Built Models and Libraries
Python has many libraries that one can build a full-stack application by simply just reusing the existing libraries with very little need to code. 
Thereby, productivity increases by drastically bringing down the time required to code and debug.

Also, as Python has been the most preferred language for data scientists for both machine learning and deep learning model building, 
you have umpteen open-source models that are available out there, which can be downloaded and used to build your models with.
