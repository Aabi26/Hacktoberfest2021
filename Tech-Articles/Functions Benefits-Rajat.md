Benefits of functions
● Modularisation
● Easy Debugging: It is easy to find and correct the error in function as
compared to raw code without function where you must correct the
error (if there is any) everywhere the specific task of the function is
performed.
● Neat code: A code created with function is easy to read and dry run
