Blockchain technology is most simply defined as a decentralized, distributed ledger that records the provenance of a digital asset.
By inherent design, the data on a blockchain is unable to be modified, which makes it a legitimate disruptor for industries like payments, cybersecurity and healthcare.

Blockchain, sometimes referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and transparent through
the use of decentralization and cryptographic hashing.

A simple analogy for understanding blockchain technology is a Google Doc. When we create a document and share it with a group of people,
the document is distributed instead of copied or transferred. This creates a decentralized distribution chain that gives everyone access to the document at the same time. 
No one is locked out awaiting changes from another party, while all modifications to the doc are being recorded in real-time, making changes completely transparent

**The whole point of using a blockchain is to let people — in particular, people who don't trust one another — share valuable data in a secure, tamperproof way.**
