"Be patient with yourself. Self growth is tender; it's holy ground. There's no greater investment. - Stephen Covey"
Not all self improvement books are made equal. Some help start you start out on your own journey others give you a boost when you've achieved experience in certain areas.
Here are my few favourites that I recommend to read atleast once in your lifetime
1) The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey
2) Eat That Frog! by Brian Tracy
3) Think and Grow Rich by Napoelean Hill
4) Mindsight by Daniel J. Siegel
5) How To Win Freinds And Influence People by Dale Carnegie
6) Failing Forward by John C. Maxwell
7) The Power Of Now by Eckhart Tolle
8) The Man's Search For Meaning by Victor E. Frankl
9) Smarter,Faster,Better by Charles Duhigg
10) The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho
        Time to time reading of "Chankaya Neetis" can also help you become a man/ woman of your dreams. So if you are looking to step up your own self- imrpovement and invest in yourself make sure read them all.
