DATA STRUCTURE



Data structures are the building blocks of any program or the software. Choosing the appropriate data structure for a program is the most difficult task for a programmer. Following terminology is used as far as data structures are concerned

Data: Data can be defined as an elementary value or the collection of values, for example, studentâ€™s name and its id are the data about the student.

Group Items: Data items which have subordinate data items are called Group item, for example, name of a student can have first name and the last name.
