<Most often, people are confused how to begin their coding life.
Sometimes, people dwell from one language to another , for selecting the best one , but end up creating confusions and feel demotivated . In the following article, I am going 
to address the most dynamic question “HOW TO BEGIN WITH CODING”. I will also mention my experience of starting coding .
Frankly speaking , all programming languages have similar structure , similar logic , only difference comes in the writing formats . For example , for printing anything on the 
screen , we use ‘ printf ’ in ‘C’ language while we use ‘cout’ in ‘C++’ language. Here, the basic function is same — printing , but different languages have different writing
formats for it . So , If you do master the logic , the essence of any one language , you can easily switch and master any other programming language as well .
You can begin with any programming language that suits you .My personal favorite beginning language is ”C++”. Most of C++ functions , can be seen in other programming languages,
so It become easy to switch to any other language like C , Java etc .

It is easy to code in C++, since It provides a handy as well as transparent syntax , You can see the things happening , It helps to develop the logic in our mind . Starting from
the basics , is a bit tedious task , one might see new words, syntax , many times you will miss semicolons and face plenty of compilation errors , but one should not give up and
continue the streak , with a positive mindset because everyone faces the same challenges , in learning new things . As you pass some time with coding , you gradually feel 
comfortable and friendly with C++. Now as have acquired enough knowledge of language , you could start making your own projects , as well as you can begin competitive programming.
Doing our own Projects helps your mind to develop logic as well as creates interest in the field . With Competitive programming , one can improve his problem solving skills , that 
are required at every point in life .
“ Practice is the key to success ‘’ , the quote holds same in the field of coding as well . The more coding you do , the more problems you solve , the more projects you work on ,
more close you arrive to attaining excellence in programming . Also it boosts confidence in us and charge us to do more and more .
There are various online platforms , that helps to learn and practice programming languages , in a easy and systematic manner . There are worldwide communities of developers ,
programmers and what not . There are learning modules , courses , which helps in building the concepts from basic to advanced . There are various events , competitions to showcase
your skills and talents and helps in improving . And a lot more opportunities to learn , grow , compete .
BOTTOM LINE — “ Just choose C++ or any of your desired programming language , and start exploring the dynamic world of Coding ”>
