It’s almost harder to understand all the acronyms that surround artificial intelligence (AI) than the underlying technology. 
Couple that with the different disciplines of AI as well as application domains and it’s easy for the average person to tune out and move on.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) -the broad discipline of creating intelligent machines
Machine Learning (ML) -refers to systems that can learn from experience
Deep Learning (DL) -refers to systems that learn from experience on large data sets
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) -refers to models of human neural networks that are designed to help computers learn
Natural Language Processing (NLP) -refers to systems that can understand language
Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) -refers to the use of computer hardware and software-based techniques to identify and process human voice

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the overarching discipline that covers anything related to making machines smart.
Whether it’s a robot, a refrigerator, a car, or a software application, if you are making them smart, then it’s AI. 
Machine Learning (ML) is commonly used alongside AI but they are not the same thing. ML is a subset of AI. ML refers to systems that can learn by themselves. 
Systems that get smarter and smarter over time without human intervention. Deep Learning (DL) is ML but applied to large data sets.
Most AI work now involves ML because intelligent behavior requires considerable knowledge, and learning is the easiest way to get that knowledge.
The image below captures the relationship between AI, ML, and DL.
