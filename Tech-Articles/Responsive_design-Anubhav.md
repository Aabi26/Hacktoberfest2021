When you think of the term responsive design, what comes to mind?
Is it mobile devices versus desktop devices? Is it designing in a way that works across screen sizes? 
Thinking about mobile touch versus using a mouse? Is it components changing shape based on where they are laid out on the page?
That might be how we used to think about responsive design, but it’s definitely not all there is to it. 
And the way that we can, and should, be thinking about responsive design is how responsive design affects a user’s context and how we can be the most responsive to the user’s needs and experience.

Screen size is a small part of that context, but so are these elements when the user is accessing your application:

The user’s location
The light level and noise level
The time (including timezone) of where they currently are.
How they are holding the device, and how they best access their device (personal settings on that device).
The future of responsive design is a user’s context in space and time, their devices context in space and time, and the user’s preferences on said devices in space and time. 
It’s all of these things. Today’s web browsers we access and develop for give us the power to leverage these inputs in our designs. We can now access the location, light level or light preference, orientation, and battery-level of a device, and make design choices around these elements.
