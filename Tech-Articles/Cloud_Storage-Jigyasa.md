CLOUD STORAGE 

As the world perceives it to be an alien concept, through this article I seek to bring more imaginability to the concept. 

With the sudden boom in the technological world , we all have a data overdose .Cloud storage has now come to our rescue.
Just like the amount of water that we need for our whole lives, does not come to us, it remains in the cloud .
With the aid of water cycle, it precipitates and evaporates to suffice our daily needs. 
Similar is the case with Cloud storage, all the data that we need does not come to us all at once, it is
rather stored in the cloud from where the user can access it when need arises through simple login credentials.

The very fact that processing on a system depends on time and memory , so to enable better performances, one should keep most of 
the data that is not required on daily basis ,on cloud . The various platforms that one can use are Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure ,etc.
They have various tools provided free of cost and also encourage developers to publish meaningful tools at reasonable prices.

As we progress further in the digital era where data is the new oil, Cloud storage as a tool would definitely prove to be worth leveraging.
