                                          Pointers in C



What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address.



How to Use Pointers?
There are a few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very frequently. (a) We define a pointer variable, (b) assign the address of a variable to a pointer and (c) finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand.


NULL Pointers
It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not have an exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.

Pointers in Detail
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C programming. The following important pointer concepts should be clear to any C programmer âˆ’

Sr.No.	Concept & Description
1	Pointer arithmetic
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used in pointers: ++, --, +, -

2	Array of pointers
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.

3	Pointer to pointer
C allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.

4	Passing pointers to functions in C
Passing an argument by reference or by address enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.

5	Return pointer from functions in C
C allows a function to return a pointer to the local variable, static variable, and dynamically allocated memory as well.
