ADVANTAGES OF DJANGO FRAMEWORK:

1)KISS and DRF compliant
2)Batteries-included 
3)Intelligent Templating System
4)Powerful Object Relational Mapper(ORM)
5)Automatic Admin Interface    
6)REST framework
7)Safety and Security
8)Testing and Debugging Support

1)KISS and DRF complaint:-
The ‘Don’t Repeat Yourself’ and ‘Keep It Short and Simple’ philosophy is closely followed by the Django web framework. The simplicity and reusability of elements are the main cornerstones of Python, and Django effortlessly carries it onward.

Templates, automatic data relations, admin dashboard, and other conventions, ensure that your project spends minimum time in the coding phase. Thus using Django will help you when you require quick prototyping and a short time-to-market.
2)Batteries included:-
Django framework is batteries-included, meaning it comes inbuilt with a lot of tools and utilities that add to the building of complex web applications. 

It incorporates an admin panel, user interface, testing web browsers, code editing tools, indentation, productive user interface and more.
 
It includes popular libraries and tools such as Django REST, which helps developers in building web APIs (application programming interfaces). Django CMS, which is designed to manage website content, is also an example of a widely used web library.
3)Intelligent Templating System:-
Django template is a text document or a Python string that later gets converted to markup Python code using the Django template language (DTL). The template engine is designed to be familiar and useful, striking a balance between feature-richness and ease of use.

It’s similar to HTML, and thus comfortable and easy to learn. Django templates are highly flexible allowing developers to augment the template language as per
The template engine allows your company to use familiar technology and customize it to your design.
4)Powerful ORM:-
The Django ORM provides a bridge between the relational database tables and models, keeping the hassle of maintaining and updating large databases. 

In addition, it supports all the major relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, if your organization is reluctant to shift to Django’s in-built ORM.

Django applications are perfect when you are developing data-driven content management systems, as they can handle large datasets.

It also comes equipped with data-plotting and analyzing tools, which can help you analyze your user data and strategize your marketing.
5)Automatic Admin Interface:-
Django’s automatic admin interface is one of the most powerful admin panel generation tools for frameworks. It acts as an internal management tool for your business and is useful for managing content on your site.

It reads metadata from your models to create a powerful and production-ready interface for admins. You can simply customize the interface to your requirements.
6)REST Framework:-
Django REST Framework(DRF) is a powerful toolkit for developing web APIs. Using DRF you can significantly reduce your development time and create RESTful APIs. 

The Django web application acts as a REST server, for simplified serialization, handling authentications and permissions. These web APIs enhance your web application with new, unique features, adding to your object’s functionalities.
7)Safety and Security:-
Django has one of the best security systems out there. A Django app is safe and secure, promoting good security practices in developers.

It helps developers avoid common security issues such as:

> SQL injection
> Cross-site request forgery
> Cross-site scripting injection

The Django framework is regularly updated with new security patches, and also provides protection against cybersecurity attacks such as Clickjacking attacks, CRLF injections, and timing attacks.
8)Testing and Debugging:-
Automated testing is an extremely useful debugging and testing tool for web developers. Django provides a set of tools that automate the testing process.

The test client is a Python class that acts like a dummy web browser, allowing you to test your views and interact with your Django application.

It also allows you to test the output of your asynchronous views using the test client or even write your own fully asynchronous tests for your Django project.

Thus it is more equipped for test-driven development compared to other frameworks.
